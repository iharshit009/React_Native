React primitives render to native platform UI, meaning your app uses the same native platform APIs other apps do.

# My Journey to React Native
I stared working on some basic projects from creating a simplest view with two buttons and than move to get knowlegde about flex properties
Later grow to build project implementing API and Intergrating with Firebase
All of my Project could be found in this Repo
